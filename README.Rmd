# algo

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The `algo` package allows you to implement the [Algolia Places](https://community.algolia.com/places/) Address Search Auto Completion Menu on shiny Text Inputs.



## Setup

In order to use the Algolia Places JavaScript library, you'll need create a free [Places](https://community.algolia.com/places/pricing.html) application in which you can get an **ID** and an __API KEY__. When you sign up, you'll be able to run 100,000 requests/month which is quite cool for most users. 

After that, set your credentials within the __.Renviron__ file which can be opened with:  

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# install.packages("usethis")

usethis::edit_r_environ()

```

Then, store the value of your credentials as follows: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# These credentials are fakes and used  to give you an idea

ALGOLIA_ID= LSKDFNSFSD  

ALGOLIA_KEY= 29453SKVNEV43T3G3KVEEV



```

Finally, save your .Renviron file, close it and restart your R session. 



## Installation


You can install the development version of `algo` from Github with: 


```{r, eval=FALSE}

# install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("feddelegrand7/algo")


```


## How to use the algo package


The `algo` package has two functions: 

+ `use_algolia()`: you must put the `use_algolia()` function at the beginning of your shiny UI. It doesn't take any argument. It only allows you to activate the Algolia Places JavaScript library. 

+ `algo()`: you'll implement an address search auto completion menu on any shiny text input using this function. 


## Example


Let's create a basic shiny application to demonstrate the features of the package: 



```{r, eval = FALSE}

library(shiny)
library(algo)


ui <- fluidPage(
  
  use_algolia(), 
  
  
  textInput(inputId = "inp1", label = "Please introduce your address", width = "800px"), 
  
  
  algo(element = "#inp1", type = "address") # Don't forget to add the # to your ID
  
)


server <- function(input, output) {




}

shinyApp(ui, server)

```

Using the `type` argument you can specify which type of geographic information to collect: 


```{r, eval = FALSE}

library(shiny)
library(algo)


ui <- fluidPage(
  
  use_algolia(), 
  
  
  textInput(inputId = "inp1", label = "Please introduce your country", width = "800px"), 
  
  textInput(inputId = "inp2", label = "Now introduce your city", width = "800px"),
  
  
  algo(element = "#inp1", type = "country"), # Don't forget to add the # to your ID
  
  algo(element = "#inp2", type = "city")
  
  
)


server <- function(input, output) {




}

shinyApp(ui, server)

```

You can also specify in which country (or countries) you want to get the addresses. This will set a delimitation according to the chosen country:



```{r, eval=FALSE}


library(shiny)
library(algo)


ui <- fluidPage(
  
  use_algolia(), 
  
  
  textInput(inputId = "inp1", label = "Where do you live in Japon ?", width = "800px"), 
  
  
  algo(element = "#inp1", type = "address", countries = "jp"), # Don't forget to add the # to your ID
  

  
)


server <- function(input, output) {




}

shinyApp(ui, server)

```

Further, you can specify which language should be displayed when collecting the addresses (note that it will only translate partially the addresses): 


```{r, eval=FALSE}


library(shiny)
library(algo)


ui <- fluidPage(
  
  use_algolia(), 
  
  
  textInput(inputId = "inp1", label = "Where do you live in Germany ?", width = "800px"), 
  
  
  algo(element = "#inp1", type = "city", countries = "es", language = "de"), # Don't forget to add the # to your ID
  

  
)


server <- function(input, output) {




}

shinyApp(ui, server)

```
